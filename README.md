# project-game-SFML
This game project is inspired by the meteor shooting game. For the best experience, plug the charger into your computer. You must control the character (specifically your plane) to destroy the enemies and protect them so that they do not overtake you. This game has 7 levels, the higher you score, the level will increase. You will get a random score of 5 to 20 when you hit the target (meteor) and there will be 1 reward. When you shoot rewards or collide with them you will gain 1 point and restore 1 health. Conversely, if you let the meteors pass or hit them, you will not get points and lose 1 health. When the blood runs out, the game will stop.
